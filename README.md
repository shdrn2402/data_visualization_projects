| Project link | Project description |
|:-----------------|:---------------|
| [Case #4<br>Data_Bank](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Case_Study_4_Data_Bank) | This project visualizes insights from the [Data Bank](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%234-Data%20Bank) case study. The goal is to present key findings from customer node analysis and transaction data to support marketing strategies and decision-making for data provisioning. The visualizations help illustrate security features, customer behavior, and data allocation strategies for potential investors and customers. </br> **Tools used:** </br> - Programming Language: Python; </br> - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn; </br> - IDE: Jupyter Notebook. |

**Note:** This repository contains visualizations based on SQL case studies. Since the projects are educational and access to a live database is not available, all resulting tables were manually saved as CSV files. In a real-world scenario, direct database access could be achieved using appropriate Python libraries such as `SQLAlchemy` or `psycopg`.
