| Project link | Project description |
|:-----------------|:---------------|
| [Eight-week-SQL-challenge_Visualization](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge_Visualization) | This repository contains visualizations of SQL queries executed as part of the [Eight-week-SQL-challenge](https://github.com/shdrn2402/Eight-week-SQL-challenge/tree/main). The goal is to present query results in a more intuitive and visually accessible format, making it easier to analyze trends, compare metrics, and gain insights from the data. </br> **Tools used:** </br> - Programming Language: Python; </br> - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn; </br> - IDE: Jupyter Notebook. |

**Note:** This repository contains visualizations based on SQL case studies. Since the projects are educational and access to a live database is not available, all resulting tables were manually saved as CSV files. In a real-world scenario, direct database access could be achieved using appropriate Python libraries such as `SQLAlchemy` or `psycopg`.
